# 3550Server2
CSCE 3550 Project 2 - Extending the RESTful JWKS Server


Hi, this is my project! My RESTful JWKS Server Project 2 for my CSCE 3550 Course.

I have the server, and tried to include my own test suite as well as linting through pylint and pylance.

I also included this README.md file and the appropriate comments within the server code in order to properly document my code.

I included a test suite that tests the coverage of the code, I ran it using  coverage report -m.

I graded it using the gradebot program. I first ran the program, then I did ./gradebot project2 to test.
